        <h1><strong>Mastiff</strong> by Tamora Pierce</h1>
        <h2>Get ready for some amazing weirdness! (^O^)/</h2>
        <p>This is the third book in Tamora Pierce's Beka Cooper series. Before reading this book, I recommend reading Terrier and Bloodhound first (Chronological order, people! Chronology is very sensible). If you are considering to read all of Tamora Pierce's series, I would recommend you to start with this series, and then read Alanna's, then Daine's , then Kel's, then Aly's series (this is also chronologically ordered, but I haven't read the Circle of Magic yet, so I don't know where that series would go in this list). Enjoy!</p>

        <h3><em>Synopsis</em></h3>
        <p>Mastiff is the last book of the Beka Cooper trilogy by Tamora Pierce. It takes place during June and July of 249 H.E.(Human Era), in the Lower City region of Tortall. The main character, Beka Cooper is at her fianc√©'s funeral, extremely guilty that she is not morning. She was about to call the engagement off when slave raiders killed him. Beka's friends try to comfort her, not really knowing that what bothered her wasn't his death, but guilt.</p>
        <p>A few days later, she is woken up in the middle of the night by Lord Gershom, a noble and Beka's adoptive father. He sent her on a mission along with her police partner, Tunstall (in this world, they call the policewomen and men 'Dogs').</p>
