        <h1><strong>Mastiff</strong> by Tamora Pierce</h1>
        <h2>Get ready for some amazing weirdness! (^O^)/</h2>
        <p>This is the third book in Tamora Pierce's Beka Cooper series. Before reading this book, I recommend reading Terrier and Bloodhound first (Chronological order, people! Chronology is very sensible). If you are considering to read all of Tamora Pierce's series, I would recommend you to start with this series, and then read Alanna's, then Daine's , then Kel's, then Aly's series (this is also chronologically ordered, but I haven't read the Circle of Magic yet, so I don't know where that series would go in this list). Enjoy!</p>
